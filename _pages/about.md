I received my B.S, M.S degree (with honors) in Electrical Engineering and Automation, Electrical and Control Engineering from Shanghai Ocean University and Fudan University, China, in 2019 and 2022, respectively. I‚Äôm current pursing my Ph.D. degree on the interface of energy storage and power systems, electrochemistry and aritificail intelligence (AI), sponsored by a joint training program from Tsinghua University and UC Berkeley. I work with Prof. [Xuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=B-I9FY8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Guangmin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=smzbtMcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Scott Moura](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5sLngc0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Hongbin Sun](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/shb.htm) with a balanced focus on real wolrd applicaiton and theoretical depth. I was also a research intern in Tencent AI Lab and Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). \| [\[CV\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nTQgSXYFpNPcvuclv0ixZGA5rLxwBKjr/view?usp=drive_link) (updated 15 Dec 2024) 

My research interest includes **AI**-enabled **applications** for **sustainable use of retired electric vehicle batteries** (reuse and recycling), e.g., power grid energy storage and strategical material recycling.
Special attention is paid to state estimation and aging pattern diagnosis under **limited and heterogeneous data availability**. I also work closely with material scientist on AI for Science (**AI4S**) topics.

I have pubulished serveral research papers on **Nature Catalysis**, **Nature Communications**, **Energy and Environmental Science**, **ACS Energy Letters**, **Journal of Power Sources** and **Applied Energy**, etc. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=MHzCCogAAAAJ&view_op=list_works'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
