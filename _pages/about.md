Non-destructive degradation trajectory prediction needs observations that has not yet been established. [Here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/ee/d4ee03839h), the authors propose a physics-informed model to predict battery lifetime trajectories by computing thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, saving costly and time-consuming data curation for sustainable manufacturing, reuse, and recycling.

Data scarcity and heterogeneity impede the estimation of retired battery capacity. [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54454-0), the authors propose a generative learning method that extends measured data space, potentially reducing curation time, cost and facilitating their sustainable reuse and recycling.
